# Why are you even reading this?

Are you looking for a "gentle" productivity app? A "mindful" meditation tool? A "supportive" community? 

**FUCK OFF.**

NoMoreBS is for people who are tired of being lazy pieces of shit. We don't do "positive reinforcement." We do "brutal honesty."

### Features:
- **Focus Timer:** A timer that insults you if you stop.
- **Task List:** A list of things you'll probably fail to do.
- **Satire Levels:** From "Mild Disappointment" to "Total Emotional Destruction."
- **Zero Support:** If you have a problem, it's probably your fault.

### How to use:
1. Stop being a loser.
2. Open the app.
3. Do your fucking work.

### Installation:
If you're too stupid to figure out how to run a basic web app, you're exactly why this app exists.
