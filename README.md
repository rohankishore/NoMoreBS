# Why are you even reading this?

Are you looking for a "gentle" productivity app? A "mindful" meditation tool? A "supportive" community? 

**FUCK OFF.**

NoMoreBS is for people who are tired of being lazy pieces of shit. We don't do "positive reinforcement." We do "brutal honesty."

### Features:
- **Focus Timer:** A timer that insults you if you stop.
- **Task List:** A list of things you'll probably fail to do.
- **Satire Levels:** From "Mild Disappointment" to "Total Emotional Destruction."
- **Zero Support:** If you have a problem, it's probably your fault.

### How to use:
1. Stop being a loser.
2. Open the app.
3. Do your fucking work.

### Deployment for Lazy People (The "Pro" Way)

If you're hosting this on Vercel, Netlify, or similar, don't manually edit `env-config.js` like a caveman. 

1. **Add Environment Variables** in your hosting dashboard:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
2. **Set the Build Command** to:
   `printf "window.ENV = { SUPABASE_URL: '%%s', SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: '%%s' };" "$SUPABASE_URL" "$SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" > env-config.js`

This will generate the config file automatically during deployment so your users don't have to do anything except fail at their tasks.

## Contributing (If you're not useless)

Think you're funny? Think you can hurt feelings better than I can? Prove it.

We're looking for:
- **More Insults:** The current ones are getting too "nice." We need stuff that actually makes people want to delete their accounts.
- **Hostile Features:** Anything that makes the user experience more miserable and productive.
- **Bug Fixes:** If you find a bug, fix it yourself. Don't open an issue like a little bitch.

**How to contribute:**
1. Fork this repo (if you even know how).
2. Add your creative verbal abuse.
3. Open a Pull Request.
4. If your insults are weak, I'll close it and block you.

Now go away.
